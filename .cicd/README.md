# CI/CD and Docker-related possibilities

SQL-Ledger now comes with some Docker-related additions. Currently two
use-cases are supported:

* Local development (on a workstation that is running Docker)
* Jenkins-based deployment (with Traefik as reverse proxy)

See [docker/README.md](docker/README.md) for further informations.
